## About Me
Hi, my name is Hannah Alphin. Currently, I work as a junior ISD for an eLearning company that develops instructional courses for the military. Besides going over Khan Acadamey's _Hour of Code_ [https://www.khanacademy.org/hourofcode], I have minimal experience with HTML coding. As a result, I am looking forward to learning more about it in this class. I know this is a skill that would benefit me to learn and I can _definitely utilize_ in my field. I am **excited** to be learning with you all this semester! Hi, my name is Hannah Alphin.
